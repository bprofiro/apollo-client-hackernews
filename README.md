## 💻 About

Hacker News - This project was created using Vite, React, GraphQL and Apollo Client.

With it we can save links, list them in a paginated way, search for a specific link and list them in order by which links have the most likes, in addition to having all the authentication part.

It was created with the intention of understanding more about the consumption of GraphQL APIs using the Apollo Client and bringing Cache Management solutions inside Apollo to the team I work with.
